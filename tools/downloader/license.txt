	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
	
	   1. Definitions.
	
	      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
	      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
	
	      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
	      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
	
	      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
	      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
	      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
	      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
	      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
	      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
	      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
	
	      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
	      exercising permissions granted by this License.
	
	      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
	      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
	      source, and configuration files.
	
	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.
	
	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	
	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
	      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
	
	   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
	
	   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
	
	      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
	      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
	      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
	      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
	      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
	      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
	      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
	      identification within third-party archives.

	# caffe-googlenet-bn
	
	This model is a re-implementation of [Batch Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) publication, and the model is trained with [a customized caffe](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe); however, the modifications are minor. Thus, you can run this with the currently available official caffe version, including cudnn v4 support and multigpu support.  
	
	The network definition and solver prototxt files are modified from https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models/bvlc_googlenet 
	
	Notes:
	- training with random crop;
	- training without any data-augmentation except random crop;
	- uses "xavier" to initialize the weights;
	- training with real-time shuffle with a modified [data_reader.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/data_reader.cpp);
	- ~~batch normalization layer is modified version of https://github.com/ChenglongChen/batch_normalization. The modified bn layer supports batch normalization for inference. (See [neuron_layers.hpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/include/caffe/neuron_layers.hpp), [bn_layer.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/bn_layer.cpp), and [bn_layer.cu](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/bn_layer.cu))~~
	- the official batch normalization layer is used and the usage of it is adopted from https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks.
	- use [test_bn.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe/blob/master/tools/test_bn.cpp) and [predict_bn.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe/blob/master/tools/predict_bn.cpp) for inference. 
	- use a mini-batch of 64 on 2 GPUs, i.e. 32 per GPU
	- use ILSVRC2015 labels, instead of 12' label.
	- Data (images) are resized with 256 x 256 [convert_imageset.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe/blob/master/tools/convert_imageset.cpp).
	
	The uploaded caffemodel is the snapshot of 1,200,000 iteration (30 epochs) using solver_stepsize_6400.prototxt
	
	The uploaded model achieves a top-1 accuracy 72.05% (27.95% error) and a top-5 accuracy 90.87% (9.13% error) on the validation set, using a single center crop.
	
	Thank John Lee for helping me training this model. 
	
	
	# Tips for performance 
	
	1. Real-time data shuffling is important
	2. Data augmentation during training should improve the accuracy.
	3. Change interpolation method (default is bilinear) of opencv to bicubic when you convert image will give you minor improvement.   
	
	# To-do
	
	1. Data augmentation

	This model is a replication of the model described in the [AlexNet](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks) publication.
	
	Differences:
	- not training with the relighting data-augmentation;
	- initializing non-zero biases to 0.1 instead of 1 (found necessary for training, as initialization to 1 gave flat loss).
	
	The bundled model is the iteration 360,000 snapshot.
	The best validation performance during training was iteration 358,000 with validation accuracy 57.258% and loss 1.83948.
	This model obtains a top-1 accuracy 57.1% and a top-5 accuracy 80.2% on the validation set, using just the center crop.
	(Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) * 2 mirror, should obtain a bit higher accuracy.)
	
	This model was trained by Evan Shelhamer @shelhamer

	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.
	
	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.
	
	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

	      source, and configuration files.
	
	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.
	
	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	
	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
	
	   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
	
	   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	      source, and configuration files.
	
	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.
	
	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	
	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      source, and configuration files.
	
	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.
	
	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	      source, and configuration files.
	
	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

	      source, and configuration files.
	
	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.
	
	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	
	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
	      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      source, and configuration files.
	
	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
	      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

* face-reidentification-retail-0095 - This is a lightweight network for the face re-identification scenario. It is based on MobileNet V2 backbone, which consists of 3x3 inverted residual blocks with squeeze-excitation attention modules. Instead of the ReLU6 activations used in the original MobileNet V2, this network uses PReLU ones. After the backbone, the network applies global depthwise pooling and then uses 1x1 convolution to create the final embedding vector. The model produces feature vectors which should be close in cosine distance for similar faces and far for different faces.

	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and

	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.

	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

* landmarks-regression-retail-0009 - This is a lightweight landmarks regressor for the Smart Classroom scenario. It has a classic convolutional design: stacked 3x3 convolutions, batch normalizations, PReLU activations, and poolings. Final regression is done by the global depthwise pooling head and FullyConnected layers. The model predicts five facial landmarks: two eyes, nose, and two lip corners.

	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

* person-reidentification-retail-0076 - This is a person reidentification model for a general scenario. It uses a whole body image as an input and outputs an embedding vector to match a pair of images by the Cosine distance. The model is based on RMNet backbone that was developed for fast inference. A single reidentification head from the 1/16 scale feature map outputs the embedding vector of 256 floats. The model is provided without last calibration layer, but can be used in the same way as the original model (with insignificant drop in accuracy).

	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

	      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

	      source, and configuration files.
	
	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.
	
	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	
	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
	      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:
	
	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
	      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

* driver-action-recognition-adas-0002-decoder - This is an action recognition model for the driver monitoring use case. The model uses Video Transformer approach with MobileNetv2 encoder. It is able to recognize the following actions: drinking, doing hair or making up, operating the radio, reaching behind, safe driving, talking on the phone, texting.
This model is only decoder part of the whole pipeline. It accepts stack of frame embeddings, computed by driver-action-recognition-adas-0002-encoder, and produces prediction on input video. Video frames should be sampled to cover ~1 second fragment (i.e. skip every second frame in 30 fps video).

	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

* action-recognition-0001-decoder - This is an general-purpose action recognition model for Kinetics-400 dataset. The model uses Video Transformer approach with ResNet34 encoder. Please refer to the kinetics <https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/open-source-datasets/kinetics/> dataset specification to see list of action that are recognised by this model.
This model is only decoder part of the whole pipeline. It accepts stack of frame embeddings, computed by action-recognition-0001-encoder, and produces prediction on input video. Video frames should be sampled to cover ~1 second fragment (i.e. skip every second frame in 30 fps video).

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

* driver-action-recognition-adas-0002-encoder - This is an action recognition model for the driver monitoring use case. The model uses Video Transformer approach with MobileNetv2 encoder. It is able to recognize the following actions: drinking, doing hair or making up, operating the radio, reaching behind, safe driving, talking on the phone, texting.
This model is only encoder part of the whole pipeline. It accepts video frame and produces embedding. Use driver-action-recognition-adas-0002-decoder to produce prediction from embeddings of 16 frames. Video frames should be sampled to cover ~1 second fragment (i.e. skip every second frame in 30 fps video).

	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and
	
	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and
	
	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.
	
	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.
	
	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
